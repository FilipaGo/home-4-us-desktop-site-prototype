## Context

Home4Us is a multi-brand store, founded 10 years ago and a family company whose members and unique collaborators are mother and daughter.

Even though the shop is located in a local shopping center, their business philosophy focus on proximity trading and offering a personalized service to their customers. The company's main message is “Home 4 Us: Because Life is made of Details”.

## Problem

Home4Us' original website.
</p>
<br></br>

Home4Us' old and outdated Weebly website was unsuitable for the requirements of today's users. The website was not responsive and wasn't an online shop; it had a mobile version but with a lot of navigation problems and low quality photography that didn't properly showcase the products' quality and brand values.

Home4Us Website Analytics

The website had a huge bounce rate.

## Redesign Goals and Scope

Improve the website's navigation and build a responsive online shop that can help extend their customer base to other geographical areas, without investing in the rental of new spaces for physical shops. Above all, a design that focus on the products and reflects the brand's values:

* Modernity;
* Simplicity;
* Attention to detail.

Bring Home4us' outdated website to the 21st century with a bold and edgy redesign that conveys a friendly, neighbourly and positive vibe!

## Methodology

To redesign the homepage, products' list page, product page and cart, I mapped out the following strategy:

* Briefing definition, scope and objectives;
* Target Users definition;
* Proto-personas;
* Benchmarking analysis;
* Documentation on the current site's information architecture and content inventory (as-is analysis);
* New information architecture;
* User flows;
* Wireframes;
* Visual identity;
* Mockup design:
  * [Desktop mockups](https://filipago.github.io/home-4-us-desktop-site-prototype)
  * [Mobile mockups](https://filipago.github.io/home-4-us-mobile-site-prototype/)
* Prototype.
