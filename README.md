## Project Summary

Website redesign and development (proof of concept) for Home4Us, a small Portuguese company that sells household and decoration articles with a gift shop section.

To redesign the homepage, products’ list page, product page and cart, I mapped out the following strategy:

* Client Assessment (Briefing definition, project scope and objectives);
* Research (Benchmarking Analysis, Target Users definition and Proto-personas);
* Interaction Design (Documentation on the current site's Information Architecture and Content Inventory [as-is analysis], User Flows, New Information Architecture, Wireframes);
* Visual Identity;
* User Interface Design (Mockups):
* Non-functional Prototypes;
* Development.

## Context

Home4Us is a multi-brand store, founded 10 years ago and a family company whose members and unique collaborators are mother and daughter.

Even though the shop is located in a local shopping center, their business philosophy focus on proximity trading and offering a personalized service to their customers. The company's main message is “Home 4 Us: Because Life is made of Details”.

## Problem

Home4Us' original website.
</p>
<br></br>

Home4Us' old and outdated Weebly website was unsuitable for the requirements of today's users. The website was not responsive and wasn't an online shop; it had a mobile version but with a lot of navigation problems and low quality photography that didn't properly showcase the products' quality and brand values.

Home4Us Website Analytics

<br></br>

The website had a huge bounce rate.

## Redesign Goals and Scope

Improve the website's navigation and build a responsive online shop that can help extend their customer base to other geographical areas, without investing in the rental of new spaces for physical shops. Above all, a design that focus on the products and reflects the brand's values:

* Modernity;
* Simplicity;
* Attention to detail.

Bring Home4us' outdated website to the 21st century with a bold and edgy redesign that conveys a friendly, neighbourly and positive vibe!
